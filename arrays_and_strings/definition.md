##Define In Your Own Words:

**Space Complexity**

**Time Complexity**








**WHY WE DO THIS:**

One of the biggest roadblocks to learning is often vocabulary. Our brains work best by making associations to things we already know, so it is an essential skill to be able to break down new concepts into things you are already familiar with and can relate to. The purpose of this exercise is to practice breaking down abstract concepts into ways that make sense to you.








##Feyman Technique:

1. **Choose the concept you want to understand**

Take a piece of paper and write that concept at the top of the page

2. **Pretend you are teaching the idea to someone else**

Write out an explanation of the topic as if you were trying to teach it to a new student. When you explain the idea this way you get a better idea of what you understand and where you might have some gaps.

3. **If you get stuck go back to the book**

Whenever you get stuck, go back to the source material and re-learn that part of the material until you get it enough that you can explain it on paper.

4. **Simplify your language**

The goal is to use your words, not hte words of the source matiral. If your explanation is wordy or confusing, that's an indication that you might not understand the idea as well as you thought - try to simplify the language or create an analogy to better understand it.
