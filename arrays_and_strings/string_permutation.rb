# Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other










# ##System For Solving Algorithms

# 1. **Function Signatures**

# - Define the name of the function(s) you are going to create
# - What is your input?
# - What is your output?

# 2. **Examples**

# - Create SIMPLE examples
# - What do you expect your code to do?
#   - Ex: add(2,4) --> 6 (input: 2,4 output: 6)
# - Try to cover edge cases with your examples
#   -Ex: add() --> what do you want this to return? An error? Nil? 0?

# 3. **Assumptions**

# These are normally great questions to ask your interviewee

# - Time
#   - What are my time constraints?
# _ Space
#   - What are my space constraints?
# - Domain and Range
#   - Ex: Are values always numbers?
# - Special Values
#   - Ex: Can the stack be empty?
#   - Ex: Are the inputs required to be distinct?
# - Behavior

# Are there any special behaviors you want to check for or ask about?
#   - Ex: Do you ever want to pop the minimum value?
#   - Ex: Do you ever want to pop multiple values?

# 4. **Algorithms**

# Normally, this is the part of system where you would write your pseudocode. However, because JavaScript and Ruby are both higher level languages and easy to read, you can jump right to the next step.

# 5. **Code!**

# Code your solution

# 6. **Checking back, relaxing assumptions**
