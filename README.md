##DBC White Board Wednesdays




In order to prepare for technical interviews, DBC students have started a white boarding group on Wednesday nights at DBC’s school in New York. I have the opportunity to host next week’s white boarding session. The purpose of this document is to provide some structure.

##Next Session

**Date:** May 6

**Time:** 7:00pm - 9:00pm

**Theme:** [Stacks and Ques] (https://github.com/fdel15/whiteboardingWednesdays/tree/master/stacks_and_ques)


###Structure For Each Session

**Theme For The Session**

```
WHY WE DO THIS

Each session will have a central theme to help us focus on one data structure or algorithm at a
time and not overload us with information.

```

**Prep-work:**
  - Define that week's vocab words
    - Ex: What is a Hash Table?
    - Try breaking it down into terms that you understand using the [Feynman Technique](https://github.com/fdel15/whiteboardingWednesdays/blob/master/feyman_technique.md)

```
WHY WE DO THIS

One of the biggest roadblocks to learning is often vocabulary. Our brains work best by making
associations to things we already know. It is an essential skill to be able to break down new
concepts into things you are already familiar with and can relate to. The purpose of this exercise
is to practice breaking down abstract concepts into ways that make sense to you.

```

* 2 to 3 problems based on the theme
* Students are expected to solve these problems and come to the session prepared

```
WHY WE DO THIS:

It is easier to have a group conversation when everyone is on the same page. The goal with the prep
work problems is so that when we meet on Wednesdays, students will already be familiar with the
problems and solution patterns.

```

**Whiteboarding Session:**

* 2 to 3 students define that week's vocabulary words on the whiteboard
* Each student then has to “teach” the class the term they defined

```
WHY WE DO THIS

Practice explaining your thought process and speaking in front of a whiteboard.

```

* Students are divided into 2 to 3 groups and assigned one of the prep-work problems
* Each student solves the problem (without being able to reference their notes from the prep-work)
* One student from each group is randomly chosen to solve it on the whiteboard (using [Greg’s system to solve algorithms](https://github.com/fdel15/whiteboardingWednesdays/blob/master/algorithm_system.md)

```
WHY WE DO THIS

Repetition is crucial to learning. By having the students solve the problems in advance, they are
already familiarizing themselves with the patterns needed for the solution, and practicing Greg’s
system.

```

* If student at board is not able to solve the problem they may get help from their group
	* No one else in the group is allowed to write on the whiteboard
	* They will have to articulate both what to do and why to do it to their teammate using [Greg’s system to solve algorithms](https://github.com/fdel15/whiteboardingWednesdays/blob/master/algorithm_system.md).

```
WHY WE DO THIS

If the person randomly chosen to whiteboard does not know how to solve the problem, they are still
required to think through and solve it with the help of their group. They need to know why they are
doing each step so that they can explain it to the entire class. This also allows the other group
members to practice explaining their thought process in a coherent way.

```

* Each person at the whiteboard walks through their solution using [Greg’s system to solve algorithms](https://github.com/fdel15/whiteboardingWednesdays/blob/master/algorithm_system.md):
	1. Function Signatures
	2. Examples
	3. Assumptions
	4. Algorithms
	5. Code!
	6. Checking Back, relaxing assumptions

```
WHY WE DO THIS

There are millions of different questions that you could be asked for any given interview. It is
not feasible to try and prepare for every possible question you may be asked. This makes developing
a system to solve technical questions essential. By going through the same process each time, you
are less likely to get “stuck” and are more likely to recognize patterns in the solutions. We are
going to rely on Greg’s experience at Google and expertise in this area to be the baseline for our
system, but each student should modify it in a way that makes most sense to them.

```

* After each presentation, we discuss the solution and open the floor to alternative solutions

```
WHY WE DO THIS

Hopefully students have found a few different solutions to each problem and we can discuss
trade offs between multiple solutions.

```

* Students are given a new problem to work on

```
WHY WE DO THIS

To practice what it is like walking into a technical interview and not knowing what
you will be asked.
